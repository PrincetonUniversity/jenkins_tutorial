This is small Python script that computes the [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) of an integer.
- Clone this code with:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/jenkins_tutorial.git
  ```
- This code is written for Python 3, on Princeton University clusters
  the default Python is a version 2. So, to get this to work on say adroit,
  you need to load an environment module:
  ```
  $ module load anaconda3
  ```
- To run the code:
  ```
  $ cd jenkins_tutorial
  $ python factorial.py 3
  ```
- To run the test:
  ```
  python test.py
  ```
